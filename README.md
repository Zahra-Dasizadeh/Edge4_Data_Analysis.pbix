This project, completed by our team using Power BI, focuses on analyzing and visualizing key data insights from the dataset. We developed a series of interactive reports and dashboards to explore trends, identify patterns, and highlight critical metrics. The visualizations help in understanding the relationships and performance indicators within the dataset, enabling better data-driven decisions.

Key Features:
Interactive dashboards showing key performance indicators (KPIs).
Data trends and patterns visualized over time.
Comparative analysis of different categories and metrics.
User-friendly visual interface for exploring the dataset.
